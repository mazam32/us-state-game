**U.S. States Guessing Game**

Welcome to the U.S. States Guessing Game! This interactive Python program challenges you to test your knowledge of the 50 states of the United States. Using the Turtle module for graphics and the pandas library for data manipulation, this game presents you with a blank map of the United States. Your task is to guess the names of each state.

**How to Play:**

1. **Start the Game:** Run the Python script. The game window will display a blank map of the United States.

2. **Guess the State:** Type the name of a state into the prompt window that appears.

3. **Correct Guesses:** If your guess is correct, the state name will appear on the map, and you'll be prompted to guess again.

4. **Keep Playing:** Keep guessing state names until you either guess all 50 states or choose to exit the game by typing "Exit" into the prompt.

5. **Learning Mode:** If you exit the game before guessing all states, a CSV file named "states_to_learn.csv" will be created, containing the names of the states you didn't guess. This file serves as a learning tool for future rounds.

**Files Included:**

- `50_states.csv`: This CSV file contains the names, x-coordinates, and y-coordinates of each state's location on the map.

- `blank_states_img.gif`: This image file is used as the background map of the United States.

**Additional Notes:**

- If you wish to restart the game, simply run the Python script again.

- Take your time to learn the names and locations of all 50 states for a fun and educational experience!

Enjoy playing the U.S. States Guessing Game and test your knowledge of American geography!
